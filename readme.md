# Portfolio using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript

## Description

Hello ! It was really fun to create a portfolio using only HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.


## Why no JS frameworks ?

I think it is really important to first understand raw vanilla JS instead of rushing into one of the numerous popular JS frameworks out there.

I really tried to create my own page using the little I know of JS, and I'm really glad I achieved some cool features.

## What I liked the most

It was the first time I was playing around with the Intersection Observer API, which allows to code really useful callbacks when you scroll down the page.
This is a very powerful function, supported by every major browser out there.
